This is a write-up for the task 'The Office Trouble I'

Task:
```
Dwight has taken Jim's client folder and encrypted it ! Get those clients back !
```

and a zip file called 'CLIENTS.zip' was given.

When I tried to open this zip file, it prompted for a password.

So using fcrackzip and bruteforcing with rockyou dictionary,``` $ fcrackzip -v -b -u -p rockyou.txt CLIENTS.zip```
