Hello Guys,

this is the writeup for Stringer Things task from Tasks Set 2.

using ``` $ strings find-flags-in-me | grep'{'|less ```

I found the first two flags which are 

```
inctf{y4yy!!!_found_th3_fir5t_fl4g}
InCtF{G00d_jobb!!This_is_the_2nd_on3}
```

I found the last one by searching for '}' in ghex and searching the whole file.

It was ``` inctf{th1s_1s_th3_l4st_0ne} ```
